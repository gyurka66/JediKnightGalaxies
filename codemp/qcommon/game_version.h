Versioning Explanation
* =====================
Phase.Major.Minor(suffix)
eg: v3.2.458a

Phase:			This represents an entirely new type of gameplay or design.  v1: JKG Versus, v2: JKG Coop, v3: JKG RPG, v4: JKG LMO
				See the readme for more information on game phases (these are similar to expansion packs).

Major:			This represents large new feature sets, bug fixes, improvements etc that still align to the current phase goal.  
				These are usually based on a Github Issue List Milestone. eg: https://github.com/JKGDevs/JediKnightGalaxies/milestones

Minor:			This represents small new feature sets (if any), but is mostly quality of life, security patches, and bug fixes.

suffix:			This represents a small patch or hotfix on the server.  Used for server-side only changes where clients are not required to update.  
				Uses a lowercase alphabet "number", eg: a, b, c, etc. These should only be used for hotfixes/emergencies.
